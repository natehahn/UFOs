# UFO's: The Truth IS Out There

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a webpage for those interested in UFO activities.  I will provide a short description of how to navigate the webpage below.

JavaScript was used for this page.  Styling was accomplished through the use of D3, a vizualization language.

### How-to-Navigate

![UFO Page](https://github.com/natehahn/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/static/images/UFO%20Webpage.png)

This is the webpage.  You will immediately notice an input section on your left with a table presented on the right.  This is where you can input your filters.  

![Filter](https://github.com/natehahn/UFOs/blob/main/Challenge/static/images/Filter%20Search.png)

You have five options that you can use to filter.  You can use only one filter or all five if you choose.  Simply type your desired input and press 'Enter'.  The table on the right will immediately filter on your inputs.  If you wish to clear all filters, simply reload the page.

That's it!!

### Summary

This was a 'simple' web page to provide UFO incidents to a community of interest.  The not so simple part was the coding.  Attempting to understand how to create the filter was anything but simple.  As for the content of the webpage, there was not a lot of data.  If Dana wanted to really support the effort, find more data points.  Another limitation of the page was not having a 'Clear Filters' button.  Having this would provide a smoother experience for the visitor.
